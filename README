Test Problem #1 : Heap Sort

implemented using binary tree
- just for the challenge of not using arrays as the data structure :p
- I think the code would be a lot shorter by just simply using arrays :p

using ruby 1.9 though (won't run in ruby 1.8)

Files :
- heap_sort.rb : the library
- main.rb : run using this file

To run :
ruby main.rb
